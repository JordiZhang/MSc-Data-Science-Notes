$$Skew = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^3}{s^3_x}$$
Skew indicates how skewed a distribution is. Values close to zero indicate a symmetric distribution. For a distribution to be positively skewed it means that the right tail is smaller than the left one. And viceversa.
$$Kurtosis = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^4}{s^4_x}$$Kurtosis measures how fat the tails of a distribution are. If the kurtosis is 3, it is a normal distribution. A kurtosis of $>3$ (leptokurtic) means heavy tails, and a kurtosis of $<3$ (platykurtic) means lighter tails.
