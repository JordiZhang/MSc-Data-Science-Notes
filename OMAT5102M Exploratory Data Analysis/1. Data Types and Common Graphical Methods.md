# Nominal
A nominal variable can take any value from a list of categories and specifically there is no meaning to the ordering of said categories. It is only the name of the category that is important. For example blood types are a nominal data type.
# Ordinal
Ordinal variables also take any value from a list of categories, however, the order of the categories matters. For example educational degrees, Primary, Secondary, Bachelors, Masters, PhD. This is an example of an ordinal data type.
# Discrete 
These are numerical values where the exact values are meaningful. In particular these numbers are from a set of discrete values. For example, the result of throwing two die. In particular, discrete variables are those from a finite or countably infinite set.
# Continuous
These represent a continuous spectrum of measurements of something. For example the height of a person. In particular, continuous variables are those from an uncountably infinite set.
# Graphical Methods
We have the usual ones we are already familiar with, but we will introduce a couple more.

Kernel Density Estimation, It is a smoothed histogram essentially.
