`Normal`: Useful for symmetric models with a more likely central values and smaller tails. Can be positive or negative.
`Exponential`: Decay for one. Bus arrival times follow a poisson distribution, however the inter-arrival times follow an exponential distribution. Only for positive values.
`Gamma`: For right-skewed data. Things with a high right skew can be modelled using it, cancer rates, insurance claims, etc... Only for positive values.
`Beta`: Very similar to gamma, but also allows for left skew and is more flexible. In particular it is often used to model the time to completion for a task. This is because, we can have optimistic thoughts about the task and thus the distribution is right skewed. If pessimistic, then left skewed. If neither, simply symmetric. It can also be used to model the distribution of percentages. Its domain is restricted to $[0,1]$.
# Estimating Model Parameters
`Uniform` $\sim U(0,\theta)$: $\hat{\theta}=2\bar{x}$
`Normal` $\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$: $\hat{\mu}=\bar{x},\quad \hat{\sigma}^2=s^2_x$ 
`Exponential` $\sim Exp(\lambda)$: $\hat{\lambda}=1/\hat{x}$ 
`Gamma` $\sim Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)$: $\hat{\alpha}=\bar{x}^2/s^2_x, \quad \hat{\lambda}=\bar{x}/s^2_x$
`Beta` $\sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$: $\hat{\alpha}= \bar{x}\left(\frac{\bar{x}(1-\bar{x})}{s^2_x}-1\right), \quad \hat{\beta}=(1-\bar{x})\left(\frac{\bar{x}(1-\bar{x})}{s^2_x}-1\right)$
