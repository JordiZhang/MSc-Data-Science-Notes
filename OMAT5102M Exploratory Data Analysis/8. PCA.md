The idea behind Principal Component Analysis is to create a set of uncorrelated variables that explain most of the variability of a dataset. To do this we utilize the covariance matrix which defines the covariances between the original variables of the dataset. By finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, we obtain the principal components of the dataset. The eigenvalues gives you a weight that tells you how much of the datasets variability is explained by its corresponding principal component. This properties can then be used by using only a number of the principal components to capture most of the properties of the dataset and thus reduce the number of variables.
The video below showcases the logic and derivation in a clear manner.
